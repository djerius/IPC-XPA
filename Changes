Revision history for Perl extension IPC::XPA.

      Thu Jul  6 09:30:49 EDT 2000
        - test script set max_servers to -1 when no servers were
          there, causing _Get to try to allocate that many things.

	- added check for version of ds9; older versions apparantly
	  don't do array correctly.  really shouldn't be using ds9 for
	  testing!

	- nullXPA() was was returning something which caused
	  the XS routines to complain about undef'd values.  it was
	  moved into XS land, and a more sophisticated (kludgy?)
	  thing was done to check for undef and mapping it correctly
	  to NULL.

0.02  Tue May  9 16:58:56 EDT 2000
	- fixed test script to work if more than one server is running

0.01  Wed Apr 19 13:40:48 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
