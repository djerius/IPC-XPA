IPC::XPA is an interface to the xpa library developed by the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's High Energy Astrophysics R&D
Group.  The library provides simple inter-process communication via
calls to the C<xpa> library as well as via supplied user land
programs.

For details on what the library offers, as well as the library itself,
please refer to 

	http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/xpa/


This release provides an interface to the client side routines.


INSTALLATION

This package has been tested on Perl 5.005_01, and xpa 2.0.2.  The
only platform it's been tested on is Solaris 2.6.

You will need to edit Makefile.PL to point to the xpa library and
includes.

To perform the tests, you'll need ds9 and xpans running.  ds9 is
available from 

	http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/

xpans is part of the xpa package.  note that ds9 will automatically
start xpans if it's in your path.  You'll also need Data::Dumper.
If you've got PDL, the test will use that to send an image to ds9.

To compile, test and install IPC::XPA,

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

To install a private copy, try something like

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl

to generate the Makefile.
